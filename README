= pathname3

This library is a replacement for the venerable pathname and pathname2
libraries.

The original implementation of pathname is extremely slow, and
instantiates extreme numbers of objects for relatively simple operations.
Twenty or so Pathname instantiations on some method calls is relatively
common.

An implementation by Daniel J. Berger, pathname2, improved on the original
significantly, adding Windows support, a Facade implementation, and a String-
based implementation. While his version is faster, it's still very slow at
instantiation. And it's Facade implementation misses some odd case methods
like Pathname#join.

This version will focus on being fast and lightweight, while still being pure
Ruby. Windows support will be forthcoming once I have access to a Windows
development machine. Until then, patches adding Windows compatibility are
welcome.
